    <h2>Installation</h1>
    <p>Due to a recent change in how Chrome handles extensions from outside the chrome webstore, installation is a little less straightforward.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="PandoraRipper.crx">Download the extension</a></li>
        <li>Open your extensions management window. You can do this by opening a new tab/window and pasting <strong>chrome://chrome/extensions</strong> in the url field.</li>
        <li>Drag the extension from the download bar to the extensions window.<br/><img src="img/drag.png"/></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>To save a song simply <strong>Like</strong> it.</p>
    <p>Click the extension icon to view and download your saved songs<p>
    <p><img src="img/icon.png" /></p>
    <p>When you first install the extension it may not be able to download as many as the first four songs on any of your pre-existing stations.</p>
